- Generate the background instead of using an image? It's all connected lines so that should be doable
- Generate falling rocks
- Fix jitter in level collision
- Particle system (particle: color, position, velocity, lifespan)
- Camera shake
- Hole generation (shouldn't be terribly hard with the mesh system I use)
- Lava following the player as a left boundary instead of a dead stop
- Player sprite
- Player animation...? (optional, would be cool though)
- Menu screen (html/css preferably)
- Better ground texture (don't know what yet)
- Maybe find someone to do the art or to brainstorm about the art with?
- Fix screen resizing issues'
- Time object with support for functions at specific time intervals
