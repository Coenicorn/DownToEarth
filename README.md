# unnamed geography game

A game for a school project

To build this project, run 

```
npm run build
```

and to see the result, just open the index.html file in the root directory.

My code is horrible, my pr messages are horrible, and frankly my life's decisions are horrible,
but still there's you, reading this, so I guess we both make bad decisions.

Try to have fun (It'll be hard though)!
